Keyboard remapper executed with a raspberry pi 3B and a rapsberry pi zero w. Raspberry pi 3B is where a keyboard will be connected. Pi hears what the user types on the keyboard and can execute macros and alter the input given. Then the data is sent to zero w wirelessly expecting that the zero is on and plugged to a pc or other device that can understand usb keyboards. The zero w appears as a keyboard to the pc and routes the key inputs in hid format to the pc. The setting in raspberry pi can be altered through wifi by first connecting to the raspberry pi's wifi and then altering the settings from the front end webpage (connect to ip address and port that I cant remeber now). The project is ready and working. Demonstration and additional documentation on the project working might be added somewhere in the future. The use of two raspberry pi's was necessary because one of them has usb host port that can read a keyboard and other has usb slave that can act as a keyboard. They were also accessible to us for the project.
